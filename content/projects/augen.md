# Augen: AI Vision Assistant for Accessibility

Augen is a small, AI‑based vision assistant to support accessibility. It uses computer vision and simple voice features to describe a scene and help with basic navigation. It’s a work in progress and improves slowly with feedback.

## Key Features

- **Real-time Scene Analysis**: Advanced AI models analyze camera feeds to describe surroundings in natural language
- **Voice Interaction**: Fully accessible voice-based interface with speech recognition and text-to-speech
- **Multilingual Support**: Available in 12 languages to serve a global audience
- **Accessibility-First Design**: Built from the ground up with WCAG 2.1 AA compliance
- **Cross-Platform**: Works seamlessly on web browsers with future mobile app planned

## Technology Stack

The project leverages modern web technologies and AI services:

- **Frontend**: Progressive Web App (PWA) architecture for offline capability
- **AI Vision**: Integration with common computer vision APIs
- **Speech Processing**: Web Speech API for browser-native voice interaction
- **Accessibility**: Screen reader compatibility and keyboard navigation
- **Internationalization**: i18n framework supporting RTL languages

## Goals

Augen tries to be useful in everyday moments:

1. **Independence**: Enabling users to navigate environments without assistance
2. **Inclusion**: Creating opportunities for participation in digital activities
3. **Education**: Serving as a learning tool for spatial awareness
4. **Community**: Building connections within the accessibility community

## Current Status

Actively maintained in small iterations. Feedback helps guide what to fix next. You can try a live demo at [augen.ignacio.tech](https://augen.ignacio.tech).
