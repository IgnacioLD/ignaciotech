# Hackapet: Open Source Tools for Shelters

Hackapet is a community project to help animal shelters with simple, practical tools. A small group of volunteers contributes when they can, and we move at a steady pace.

## Project Vision

Animal shelters worldwide face common challenges: limited resources, outdated systems, and overwhelming administrative tasks. Hackapet addresses these pain points by providing modern, user-friendly tools that streamline shelter operations and improve animal welfare outcomes.

## Key Applications

### Mobile App for Shelter Staff
- **Animal Profiles**: Complete medical and behavioral records
- **Adoption Matching**: Algorithm-driven compatibility matching
- **Volunteer Coordination**: Scheduling and task management
- **Inventory Tracking**: Supplies, medications, and equipment
- **Photo Management**: High-quality adoption photos and progress tracking

### Web Dashboard for Administration
- **Analytics Dashboard**: Adoption rates, length of stay, and capacity metrics
- **Financial Tracking**: Donation management and expense reporting
- **Report Generation**: Custom reports for stakeholders and grants
- **Multi-shelter Support**: Franchise and network management

## Technical Architecture

Built with modern Android development practices:

- **Architecture**: MVVM with clean architecture principles
- **Database**: Room for local storage with cloud sync capabilities
- **UI Framework**: Jetpack Compose for modern, accessible interfaces
- **Networking**: Retrofit with coroutines for efficient API calls
- **Testing**: Comprehensive unit and integration test coverage
- **CI/CD**: Automated testing and deployment pipelines

## Community

This is a small, volunteer‑led project in early development. There are no production deployments yet; we’re prototyping and gathering feedback with shelters.

- **16+ Active Contributors** from 8 countries
- **Multiple Shelter Pilots** in Spain and Portugal
- **Educational Partnerships** with veterinary schools
- **Documentation Hub** with onboarding guides
- **Community Forums** for feature requests and support

## What I'm Learning

- **Remote collaboration** across different time zones
- **Architecture trade‑offs** and planning
- **Onboarding contributors** and documentation
- **Working with shelters** and their constraints
- **Lightweight planning** for volunteer teams

## Current Roadmap

Near‑term focus:

1. Small pilot workflows with a partner shelter
2. Basic admin features and data model
3. Simple web dashboard MVP
4. Accessibility and reliability basics
