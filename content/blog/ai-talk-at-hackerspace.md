Credits to Enrique Domínguez, co‑author of the talk.

This was a practical intro to generative AI: basic concepts, common tools, and small demos people can try. We covered Midjourney, Stable Diffusion (local and hosted variants), and LLM workflows for everyday tasks.

Resources and the recording are available on YouTube.
